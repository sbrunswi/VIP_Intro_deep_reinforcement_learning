# AIDA3 - Rocket: Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Aviation

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning (RL) subgroup of AIDA3 for VIP This repository serves as ongoing documentation for our weekly learning progression, code implementations, and our current research for autonomous fixed-wing UAV control.

## Project Overview

AIDA3 Research explores and develops machine learning models to solve real-world problems in autonomous fixed-wing aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our Purdue VIP subgroup focuses specifically on the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning to create custom training environments and a better flight model.

### Key Objectives

- Curriculum Mastery: Reading through Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning by Miguel Morales to build foundational DRL knowledge.
- Custom Environment Development: Designing and implementing a Gym-compatible environment specifically for fixed-wing drones.
